# MuSSIC
-----------------------
Description of the Code
-----------------------
This code computes the partial pair radial distribution function and the partial pair structure factors for the trajectory provided in xyz file format.
The total struture factor is obtained by summing all  partial pair contributions.

## Overview

**Dissolve** is a simulation tool for the interrogation of neutron scattering data, typically total neutron scattering data. It builds on the techniques established in the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement (EPSR) method by Soper.

The basic algorithms used in both Dissolve and EPSR, and the intent of Dissolve, is described in "[Dissolve: next generation software for the interrogation of total scattering data by empirical potential generation](https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918)", _Mol. Phys._ **117**, 3464-3477 ([10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918](https://doi.org/10.1080/00268976.2019.1651918))
